em_decomp

Requirements
------------

em_decomp requires MATLAB, libSBML (with the MATLAB interface), Gurobi, and
Gurobi Mex.  It has been tested on MS Windows 7 and Mac OS X 10.6 with MATLAB
R2010b, libSBML v4.3.0 and Gurobi v4.0.1.

libSBML is available from http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML.  It must be built
to include the MATLAB interface so that the command 'TranslateSBML' is in the
MATLAB path.

Gurobi is available from http://www.gurobi.com/ and is free for academic use.
Gurobi Mex is a MATLAB interface for Gurobi that is available from
http://www.convexoptimization.com/wikimization/index.php/Gurobi_Mex:_A_MATLAB_interface_for_Gurobi.
Gurobi Mex must be compiled and installed so that the command 'gurobi_mex' is
in the MATLAB path.  The solvers GLPK, SCIP, and CPLEX can also be used (see
solve_milp.m), but these have not been tested.

Elementary mode decomposition of flux distribution in iNJ661
------------------------------------------------------------

As an example of the use of em_decomp, we illustrate how it can be applied to
obtain an elementary mode decomposition of a flux distribution in iNJ661, a
genome-scale model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

1. We first load the model using the script parse_sbml.m:

  >> fbamodel = parse_sbml('iNJ661_biomass9_plus_vitamins_0.052_flux.xml');

When prompted with "Do you want to load the model anyway? Enter y/n", respond
"y".

2. Now solve for an optimal flux distribution by FBA:

  >> v = flux_balance(fbamodel);

3. Finally, we decompose the flux distribution v into elementary modes by

  >> [P, w] = em_decomp(v, fbamodel);

This results in a 1028 x 19 matrix P containing the 19 elementary modes as
columns, and a 1 x 19 weight matrix w such that P * w' = v.
